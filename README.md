# Python_Data_Analysis
I've created a Jupyter Notebook file that includes 30 lessons to introduce using the Python language for Data Analysis . Ranging from simple mathematic operations to statistics and predictive modeling . It was with the help of a youtube channel called DataDraft and I'm grateful to him.
